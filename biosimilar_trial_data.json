The mock consultation will occur immediately after participants have read the standardized information and letter. The companion will be involved throughout the consultation (e.g., some practical information will be directed to the companion, and they will be encouraged to discuss the decision to transition with the patient). Companions will also be asked if they have any questions following the explanation about biosimilars. Non-verbal cues will accompany the verbal information, such as the healthcare provider leaning forward, facing the dyad, and using gaze when communicating.

    "Intervention": "Positive-framing and analogy explanation of biosimilars<br><br>The current intervention is information-based and explains biosimilars to patients in a positively framed way and by using an analogy.  The intervention starts with a preamble explaining that biosimilars are increasingly used in rheumatology/dermatology clinics but currently not in New Zealand. It is emphasized that the scenario which is described in the following is hypothetical and not related to the patient's current medicine. The main goal of the study - examining patients reactions to different ways of explaining a switch from a biologic to a biosimilar drug - is described. The positively framed explanation of the biosimilar follows and focuses on similarities between biosimilars and biologic drugs. Additionally patients are provided with an analogy which compares the way how biosimilars are manufactured with the concept of baking bread and the use of different brands of yeast that may be more or less expensive.<br><br>The intervention is provided by a candidate for a Masters degree in Health Psychology. The intervention is based on a standardized script and will be delivered once and individually in a face-to-face contact. It takes 5 minutes. Patients receive the intervention either in the clinic where they usually have their appointments with their rheumatologist/dermatologist or in a university research center.",
